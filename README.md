# Colleges & Athletes

There are 2 CSV files in the `/data` folder containing data for colleges & athletes. You need to build a RESTful API for interacting with this data.

* Build routes to create, read, update, delete, and list data for both athletes and colleges.
* Data should persist in a database.
  * The schema should be implemented with migrations.
  * The data in the CSV files should be loaded with seeds.
* For each college, include all of that college's athletes in the read and list responses.
* Handle errors appropriately.
* Use appropriate status codes.
* Deploy the API.
